# RSA

This repository contains codes for Reference Point based Simulated Annealing (RSA), a simulated annealing based many-objective optimization approach.

*	The folder "RSA_cpp" contains the C++ implementation. To run the code, enter the folder and type the command (in LINUX Command Shell) - g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Toolkit/ExampleProblems.cpp Toolkit/ExampleShapes.cpp Toolkit/ExampleTransitions.cpp Toolkit/FrameworkFunctions.cpp Toolkit/Misc.cpp Toolkit/ShapeFunctions.cpp Toolkit/TransFunctions.cpp 

*	The folder "RSA_py" contains the Python implementation. To run the code, simply run the main.py file.
